# Convex Structured Total Least Squares


This repository contains code for solving structured total least squares problems, i.e., problems for which both dependent and independent variables contain variable amounts of noise. The methods was developed and reported by [Malioutov & Slavov (2014)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/malioutov14.html). The [website](http://slavovlab.net/2016_PTR/index.html) of the paper contains additional resources.

## Reproducing the analysis reported by [Malioutov & Slavov (2014)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/malioutov14.html)

- The figure comparing the performance of different methods can be generated by running the code **compare_convex_STLS.m**

## Functions
- The main function is **struct_TLS_SDP_Aonly.m**
- The function **RWNN_tls.m** is a wrapper around the main function

## Dependancies
- The convex structured least squares algorithm uses several external packages listed below and included in this repository. The main function **struct_TLS_SDP_Aonly.m** assumes that these packages are in the same directory and adds them to the path.  
  * Yalmip
  * SDPT3-4.0
  * slra-0.5
